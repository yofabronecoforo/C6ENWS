[h1]Enhanced Natural Wonders Selection (ENWS) for Civilization VI[/h1]

A mod which enables additional Frontend and Ingame settings related to Natural Wonders.

ENWS enables variable amounts of Natural Wonders on standard map sizes, with new minimum, maximum, and default amounts. For each size, any specific amount greater than or equal to the minimum value and less than or equal to the maximum value can be selected using the provided slider during game setup.

ENWS replaces the built-in Natural Wonders picker with a custom version based on the built-in City-States picker, where each Natural Wonder has a second checkbox to indicate priority placement; prioritized Natural Wonders will be placed ingame before other selected Natural Wonders. If Start by Wonders is present and enabled, ENWS' priority list will be used to determine starting plots, and Start by Wonders' picker will be hidden.

Some limitations apply; please refer to the project's [url=https://github.com/zzragnar0kzz/C6ENWS#readme]README file[/url] for these and more comprehensive details. This file is also included with ENWS, and can be found where it is installed.
